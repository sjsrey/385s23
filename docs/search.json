    "text": "Course overview from GEOG 385: Spatial Data Analysis at San Diego State University\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce you to methods of spatial data analysis. The focus is on both the conceptual and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. We will place particular emphasis on the computational aspects of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) methods for three diﬀerent types of spatial data: point processes, lattice, and geostatistical. We will also cover an introduction to regression analysis on spatially referenced data. Throughout the course you will gain valuable hands-on experience with several specialized software packages for spatial data analysis. The overriding goal of the course is for you to acquire familiarity with the fundamental methodological and operational issues in the statistical analysis of geographic information and the ability to extend these methods in your own research."

In this case, pysal handles the Manhattan median the same way as numpy.median: return the average of the two middle values.\n\n#get the number of points in point pattern \"pp\"\npp.n\n\n12\n\n\n\n#Manhattan Median is not unique for \"pp\"\nmm = manhattan_median(pp.points)\nmm\n\n/home/serge/miniconda3/envs/libpysal/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pointpats/centrography.py:208: UserWarning: Manhattan Median is not unique for even point patterns.\n  warnings.warn(s)\n\n\narray([59.825, 41.23 ])\n\n\n\npp.plot()\nplt.plot(mc[0], mc[1], 'b^', label='Mean Center')\nplt.plot(wmc[0], wmc[1], 'gd', label='Weighted Mean Center')\nplt.plot(mm[0], mm[1], 'rv', label='Manhattan Median')\nplt.legend(numpoints=1)\n\n<matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x7f614d660f70>"

Given an observed point pattern, we wish to make inferences about the process that generated the observed pattern.\nThe general approach that is used is to construct measures that characterise the observed point pattern, and then compare these against the proporties of the theoretical process models we explored previously.\nFor example, if we assume that the underlying process is CSR, we know what kinds of properties the empirical patterns from such a process should exhibit. The critical thing to keep in mind is that we never actually see the underlying process - we only see outcomes of the process (i.e., the pattern).\nThis raises a number of challenges that we will need to address later on, but for now we are going to build up an inituition of the general strategy for analyzing point patterns."

These pairs would appear at the the end of a segment with arrows on both ends.\nIf we look in the extreme northwest three points, we see one pair of mutual nearest neighbors, while the third point is not a mutual nearest neighbor.\nIt is also possible for a point to be a nearest neighbor to more than a single point, as is also seen in this case.\nThe nearest neighbor distances are the lengths of these segments.\n\nMean Nearest Neighbor Distance\nOur first distance based statistic was suggested by Clark and Evans (1954) as the average nearest neighbor distances:\n\\[\\bar{d}_{min} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i} d_{i, min} \\]\nwhere \\(d_{i, min}\\) is the nearest neighbor distance for observation \\(i\\), and \\(n\\) is the number of observations.\nUnder a CSR process, the expected value of this statistic is:\n\\[E[\\bar{d}_{min}] = \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\]\nThe logic of the statistic is to compare the observed mean nearest neighbor distance to this expectation forming their ratio:\n\\[R = \\frac{\\bar{d}_{min}}{\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{\\lambda}}} = 2 \\bar{d}_{min} \\sqrt{\\lambda}\\]\nValues of \\(R<1\\) are indicative of a tendancy towards clustering since the observed nearest neighbor distances are smaller than expected under CSR.\nValues of \\(R>1\\) are indicative of a uniform or dispersed pattern.\n\nnnd.mean() # the mean nearest neighbor distance\n\n0.07360281110243255\n\n\n\ncsr.lambda_window # the intensity using the window for the point pattern\n\n64.99361066054225\n\n\n\ndmin = nnd.mean()\nlam = csr.lambda_window\nR = 2 * dmin * lam**(1/2)\nR\n\n1.1867513365512292\n\n\nLet’s compare this to the same statistic based on the mean nearest neighbor distance for the clustered pattern:\n\nnidx, nnd = clustered.knn(1) # here we have the indices of the nearest neighbors (nidx) and the distances (nnd)\n\n\ndmin = nnd.mean()\nlam = clustered.lambda_window\nR = 2 * dmin * lam**(1/2)\nR\n\n0.13087134840769868\n\n\nSo we see that the \\(R\\) value for the clustered pattern is much below 1, while the R value for the CSR pattern is slightly over 1.\nWhat we would like to know is if these values are significantly different from what we would expect if the underlying process that generated the patterns was CSR?\nOne approach is to use theoretical results on the distribution for the \\(R\\) statistic from Petrere (1985).

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nWelcome to 385: Spatial Data Analysis!\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce you to methods of spatial data analysis. The focus is on both the conceptual and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. We will place particular emphasis on the computational aspects of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) methods for three diﬀerent types of spatial data: point processes, lattice, and geostatistical. We will also cover an introduction to regression analysis on spatially referenced data. Throughout the course you will gain valuable hands-on experience with several specialized software packages for spatial data analysis. The overriding goal of the course is for you to acquire familiarity with the fundamental methodological and operational issues in the statistical analysis of geographic information and the ability to extend these methods in your own research.\nThe course takes an explicitly computational thinking approach to its pedagogy. Students are introduced to computational concepts and tools that are increasingly important to research that engages with geospatial data. By adopting these tools, students acquire a deeper engagement with, and mastery of, the substantive concepts.\nIn the scope of a 15-week semester course we can only introduce a handful of the key concepts and methods relevant to the field of spatial data analysis. As such, the course is not intended as an exhaustive treatment. Instead, the goal is that students will acquire an understanding of the more common and useful methods and practices, and use the course as an entry point for further engagement with the field."

    "text": "Grading\nGEOG385 uses specification grading in evaluating student work and in determining your final course grade. Your course grade will be based on the quality and quantity of the work that you submit that is evaluated to be of an acceptable level of quality. The acceptable level of quality demonstrates competency in the concepts and methods covered in the course.\nThere is a two-step process for determination of your final course grade at the end of the quarter:\n\nUsing your quizzes, exercises, and projects, your base grade is determined.\nUsing your final exam results, determine if your base grade includes a \"plus\", \"minus\", or level drop to form the course grade.\n\nFor Step 1, the base grade is determined using the following specification:\n\n\n\nLevel\nHurdles\n\n\n\n\nA\nPass at least 8 of 10 quizzes, earn \"Demonstrates Competency\" on 4 of 4 exercises,\n\n\n\nand submit a project that earns \"Demonstrates Competency\"\n\n\nB\nPass at least 7 of 10 quizzes, earn \"Demonstrates Competency\" on 3 of 4 exercises\n\n\nC\nPass at least 6 of 10 quizzes, earn \"Demonstrates Competency\" on 2 of 4 exercises\n\n\nD\nPass at least 5 of 10 quizzes, earn \"Demonstrates Competency\" on 1 of 4 exercises\n\n\nF\nFail to clear D-level hurdles\n\n\n\nFor Step 2, your final course grade is determined as follows:\n\nIf you earn at least 85% on the final exam, you will obtain a + for your grade. So an A base grade becomes a final A+ course grade, a B becomes a B+, and so on.\nIf you score between 70-85% on the final exam, your base grade becomes your course grade.\nIf you score between 50% and 69% on the final exam, you will obtain a - for your grade. So an A becomes and A-, a B becomes a B-, and so on.\nIf you score less than 50% on the final exam, your course grade will drop one level: An A base grade becomes a final B course grade."

Does the work demonstrate competence and meet the expectations outlined in the exercise?\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to both of the questions, a student passes the hurdle for that exercise.\nIf the initial submission does not clear the hurdle, then a second question is asked: Is there evidence of partial understanding of the concepts? If the answer to this question is \"Yes\" the student can exchange one token to attempt a revision of their work. If the answer is \"No\", the student does not clear the hurdle for this exercise and will not have the opportunity to revise their work."

There will be no opportunity for revising this final submission.\nStudents need to commit to the project by specifying their team (maximum of 4 members on a team) by 3-09. Once the commitment is made, the team composition is final. Any student who does not submit a team definition by this date will not be able to pursue the project.\nDetails on the project rubric will be given out on 2-16."

Please know accommodations are not retroactive, and I cannot provide accommodations based upon disability until I have received an accommodation letter from Student Ability Success Center.\n\n\nPrivacy and Intellectual Property\nStudent Privacy and Intellectual Property: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) mandates the protection of student information, including contact information, grades, and graded assignments. I will use Canvas to communicate with you, and I will not post grades or leave graded assignments in public places. Students will be notified at the time of an assignment if copies of student work will be retained beyond the end of the semester or used as examples for future students or the wider public. Students maintain intellectual property rights to work products they create as part of this course unless they are formally notified otherwise.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe SDSU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail. These violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic misconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabotage, non-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more information about the SDSU student academic integrity policy, please see the following: https://sacd.sdsu.edu/student-rights/academic-dishonesty.\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nAs course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for all students, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of operating system. All course participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other students throughout the semester. As a learning community we do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.\n\nAll communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in this course.\nBe kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this course.\nStudents violating these rules may be asked to leave the course, and their violations will be reported to the SDSU administration.\n\nThis code of conduct is an adaptation of the SciPy 2018 Code of Conduct."
