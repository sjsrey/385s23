# What is data?

## Data Definitions

> facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis

> the quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, being stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media.

> things known or assumed as facts, making the basis of reasoning or calculate

## Data Sets

A **data set** is a collection of **observations** recorded for individual **units** on a set of **variables**.


Variables are sometimes referred to as **attributes** or **features** (in machine
learning parlance).



## Measurement Scales


| Scale    | Operations        | Example                      |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| nominal  | mode, frequencies | Zip Code                     |
| ordinal  | A > B             | Ranks, Primary, Intermediate |
| interval | + -               | Time                         |
| ratio    | + - * /           | Weight, Kelvin               |


# What is special about *spatial* data? 

## Spatial Data is Special

> Spatial data comes in many varieties and it is not easy to arrive at a system of classification that is simultaneously exclusive, exhaustive, imaginative, and satisfying. 

-- G. Upton \& B. Fingleton

## What is special about spatial data?

### Location, Location, Location
*where matters*

### Dependence is the rule, not the exception
- spatial interaction, contagion, spill-overs
- spatial externalities

### Spatial Scale
- Inference can change with scale


## Nature of Spatial Data

### Georeferences
attribute data together with location

### Geocoding
- associate observations with location
- point: latitude-longtitude (GPS)
- areal unit: spatial reference

## Geocoding on-line

## Location

- Given: in most spatial data analysis, no choice in location
- No sampling in the usual sense
- Data = attributes augmented with **locational** information


## Spatial Effects

### The  Trilogy
- Spatial **Dependence**
- Spatial **Heterogeneity**
- Spatial **Scale**


## Spatial Dependence

### Tobler's First Law of Geography
>	"everything depends on everything else, but closer things more so"

-	Structure of spatial dependence
-	Distance Decay
-	Closeness = Similarity

## Spatial Heterogenety

### Spatial Instability

- Process varies in some way over spatial units
- Multiple forms
  - Discrete = regimes
  - Continuous = expansion method, GWR
- Trade-off
  - Spatial homogeneity = stationary process
  - Uniqueness = extreme heterogeneity 


## Spatial Scale
### Mismatch

- Spatial scale of the process
- Spatial scale of our measurement

### Issues

- points too far apart = miss small distance variation
- area aggregates cannot provide information on individual behavior
- *Ecological Fallacy*


## Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)

### Aggregation Problem

- special case of ecological fallacy
- a million correlation coefficients

### Zonation Problem
- size
- arangement
- How many ways could you partition the coterminous US land area into 48 polygons?

- True rate = 1/3 = 33\%
- A's rate =  (0 +1/2) /2  = 25\%
- A's weighted rate = 1/3 * 0 + 2/3 * 50 = 33\%
- B's rate = (0 + 100) /2 = 50\%
- B's weighted rate = 2/3 * 0 + 1/3 * 100 = 33\%

# Types of Spatial Data

## Spatial Process

### Spatial Random Field
a mathemtical construct to capture randomness of values distributed over space

$$\{Z(s):s \in D \} $$

- $s \in R^d:$ location (e.g., lat-lon)
- $D \in R^d:$ index set = possible locations
- $Z(s):$ random variable at location $s$

## Types of Spatial Data
::: {.incremental}

### Events
- addresses of crimes

### Discrete Spatial Objects
- county crime rates

### Continuous surfaces
- air quality
- rainfall
:::

## Point Pattern Analysis

### Data
- mapped pattern = all the values
- not a sample in the usual sense

### Spatial Process
- observations as a realization of a random point process
- points occur in space according to a mathematical model

## Point Patterns

### Unmarked Point Pattern
- only location is recorded
- no other attribute information

### Marked Point Pattern
- Location is recorded
- Stochastic attributes are also recorded
- e.g., sales price at address, DBH of a tree

## Areal Unit Data (Lattice)

::: block
Spatial Domain: $D$

-   Discrete and fixed

-   Locations nonrandom

-   Locations countable
:::

::: block
Examples of lattice data

-   Attributes collected by ZIP code

-   census tract

:::


## Lattice Data: Indexing


::: block
Site

-   Each location is now an area or *site*

-   One observation on $Z$ for each site

-   Need a spatial index: $Z(s_i)$
:::

::: block
$Z(s_i)$

-   $s_i$ is a representative location within the site

-   e.g., centroid, largest city

-   Allows for measuring distances between sites

## Geostatistical Analysis

::: block
Spatial Domain: $D$

-   A continuous and fixed set.

-   Meaning $Z(s)$ can be observed everywhere within $D$.

-   Between any two sample locations $s_i$ and $s_j$ you can
    theoretically place an infinite number of other samples.

-   By fixed: the points in $D$ are non-stochastic
:::

## Geostatistical Data

::: block
Continuous Variation

-   Because of the continuity of $D$

-   Geostatistical data is referred to as "spatial data with continuous
    variation."

-   Continuity is associated with $D$.

-   Attribute $Z$ may, or may not, be continuous.

## Network Data

::: block

-   A network is a system of linear features connected at intersections
    and interchanges.

-   These intersections and interchanges are called nodes.

-   The linear feature connecting any given pair of nodes is called an
    arc.

-   Formally, a network is defined as a directed graph $G = (N,
          A)$ consisting of an indexed set of nodes $N$ with $n = |N|$
    and a spanning set of directed arcs $A$ with $m = |A|$, where $n$ is
    the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of arcs.

-   Each arc on a network is represented as an ordered pair of nodes, in
    the form from node $i$ to node $j$, denoted by $(i, j)$.
